# goodtags FAQ

## why did you write goodtags?

The short version is that I wanted a better tag app, and I wanted to express my
appreciation for the barbershop community and for Fog City Singers.
See [background](background.md) for the long version.

## what happened to the pitchpipe?

It got cut in the mad dash to get out a new version for the google play store.
It might come back in future.

On the sheet music view, there's still a button to play the root of tag's key
like you could in v1. (If the key is missing from the tag's metadata, v2 uses
F since that's the most common key for tags.)

In v2 you can also long-press the "g" icon on the home screen to hear a G. That
makes it easier to get to than the pitchpipe in v1.

## what happened to sharing favorites, or cloud sync?

Cloud sync wasn't reliable, and I'm pretty sure hardly anyone was sharing favorites.
Adding the sharing feature was, honestly, a way to try to get the apple app store
to approve v1. (It seemed to work, btw.)

Both those features added a huge amount of complexity, and I decided I needed
to streamline the app if I hope to make it sustainable for the long term.

## how did you get smooth, auto-rotating transitions to/from sheet music in v2?

So glad you asked. See [transitions](./transitions.md).
